          At Fanatics Football, we play <b>Football</b>. We are an 11-on-11,
          8-Team league, where each team operates the way they want. Only want
          to practice once a week? Great! Don’t want to practice at all?
          Perfect! Just want to strap up on game day and get after it? 100%
          Let’s Go! We are for anyone who misses the feeling of going out, under
          the lights, and playing all out for 60 minutes. Our equipment is top
          notch; our uniforms, outstanding; and our customizable helmets allow
          our players the freedom of design and promotion of their
          brand/business. We are a league that values the tradition of football
          and keeps the integrity of the game. So, live the dream, strap up, and
          joint us, today.
